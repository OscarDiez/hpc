In this implementation, jobs are stored in a heap, which is a complete binary tree that maintains the smallest element at the root. This property allows the scheduler to always select the highest-priority job (smallest value) quickly.\n","\n","- **`heapq.heappop`**: This function pops the smallest item from the heap, which in our case is the job with the highest priority. The heap is automatically adjusted after each pop to ensure that the smallest item is always at the root. This makes the priority-based scheduling both efficient and easy to manage.\n","\n","### Questions to Consider\n","- How does job priority affect the overall system efficiency?\n","- What are the trade-offs between FCFS and priority-based scheduling?\n","- How might different scheduling strategies impact the completion time of individual jobs?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ADv388c_xdsr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import heapq\n","import time\n","\n","# Define jobs with (priority, job_id, execution_time, resources_needed)\n","jobs = [\n","    (1, 'Job_1', 4, 2),\n","    (3, 'Job_2', 2, 1),\n","    (2, 'Job_3', 3, 3),\n","    (1, 'Job_4', 5, 2)\n","]\n","\n","# First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduler\n","def fcfs_scheduler(jobs):\n","    print(\"FCFS Scheduling\")\n","    current_time = 0\n","    for job in jobs:\n","        print(f\"Starting {job[1]} at time {current_time}\")\n","        time.sleep(job[2])  # Simulate job execution\n","        current_time += job[2]\n","        print(f\"Completed {job[1]} at time {current_time}\")\n","\n","# Priority-based Scheduler using a Min-Heap\n","def priority_scheduler(jobs):\n","    print(\"Priority-based Scheduling\")\n","    heapq.heapify(jobs)  # Convert jobs list into a heap\n","    current_time = 0\n","    while jobs:\n","        job = heapq.heappop(jobs)  # Pop the job with the highest priority (lowest priority value)\n","        print(f\"Starting {job[1]} at time {current_time}\")\n","        time.sleep(job[2])  # Simulate job execution\n","        current_time += job[2]\n","        print(f\"Completed {job[1]} at time {current_time}\")\n","\n","# Additional Example: Round-Robin Scheduler\n","def round_robin_scheduler(jobs, time_slice):\n","    print(\"Round-Robin Scheduling\")\n","    queue = jobs[:]\n","    current_time = 0\n","    while queue:\n","        job = queue.pop(0)\n","        exec_time = min(time_slice, job[2])\n","        print(f\"Starting {job[1]} at time {current_time} for {exec_time} units\")\n","        time.sleep(exec_time)\n","        current_time += exec_time\n","        if job[2] > time_slice:\n","            # Requeue the job with remaining time\n","            queue.append((job[0], job[1], job[2] - time_slice, job[3]))\n","        else:\n","            print(f\"Completed {job[1]} at time {current_time}\")\n","\n","# Run the schedulers\n","print(\"=== FCFS ===\")\n","fcfs_scheduler(jobs)\n","print(\"\\n=== Priority-Based ===\")\n","priority_scheduler(jobs)\n","\n","# Round-Robin with a time slice of 2 time units\n","print(\"\\n=== Round-Robin ===\")\n","round_robin_scheduler(jobs, time_slice=2)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3xxyQSHkxe9J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725030100003,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":28509,"user":{"displayName":"Oscar Diez","userId":"15296249123884043247"}},"outputId":"0cd1be3b-d447-4e01-d70e-d24fdd5dda31"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["=== FCFS ===\n","FCFS Scheduling\n","Starting Job_1 at time 0\n","Completed Job_1 at time 4\n","Starting Job_2 at time 4\n","Completed Job_2 at time 6\n","Starting Job_3 at time 6\n","Completed Job_3 at time 9\n","Starting Job_4 at time 9\n","Completed Job_4 at time 14\n","\n","=== Priority-Based ===\n","Priority-based Scheduling\n","Starting Job_1 at time 0\n","Completed Job_1 at time 4\n","Starting Job_4 at time 4\n","Completed Job_4 at time 9\n","Starting Job_3 at time 9\n","Completed Job_3 at time 12\n","Starting Job_2 at time 12\n","Completed Job_2 at time 14\n","\n","=== Round-Robin ===\n","Round-Robin Scheduling\n"]}]}]}
