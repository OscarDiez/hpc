    "1. **Management Node**: Controls the overall operation of the cluster.\n",

    "4. The output file contains the result of the executed C program.\n",
    "5. Job dependencies in SLURM are managed using the `--dependency` flag with the appropriate conditions.\n",
    "6. Array jobs are created using the `--array` directive in SLURM.\n",
    "7. Detailed job information can be obtained using `scontrol` with the job ID.\n",
    "8. Node details are best explored using `scontrol show node`.\n",
